# Upgrade Guide

## v0.19 to v1.0.0

In `tailwind.config.js` you need to add more colors:

```js

  theme: {
    extend: {

      colors: {
        primary: colors.blue,
        secondary: colors.pink,

        // ADD THESE COLORS (can pick different ones from here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors)
        success: colors.green,
        danger: colors.red,
        warning: colors.yellow,
        info: colors.sky,

        // Options: slate, gray, zinc, neutral, stone
        gray: colors.gray,
      },
    },
  },
```

In your `app.scss` you need to import the default Petal Components CSS:

```css
@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "../../deps/petal_components/assets/default.css";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
```

## v0.18 to v0.19

There should be no breaking changes. This provides declarative assigns for all components so you should get warnings if you don't pass the right attributes.

### Using with Phoenix 1.7

Petal Components work fine with Phoenix 1.7 - there just will be some naming conflicts as the Phoenix generator now creates a file called `core_components.ex`, which has some function components defined in there.

To fix, go to the generated `core_components.ex` file and rename or remove the following functions: `modal`, `button` and `table`.

Unfortunately, this means the generators like `mix phx.gen.live` won't work properly. If you want generators for Petal Components, look into buying [Petal Pro](https://petal.build).

For a full upgrade commit of Phoenix 1.6 to 1.7 you can see [here](https://github.com/petalframework/petal_boilerplate/commit/dfd122902b2f1730f122efafc3d6962c2a6ce91d) how we did it with Petal Boilerplate.

If you want to pick and choose which components to use, you could namespace Petal Components.

```
defmodule PC do
  use PetalComponents
end
```

Then there would be no naming conflicts. But you would have to use the module for every component: `<PC.button></PC.button>` etc.

## v0.17 to v0.18

This guide assumes you are also updating `phoenix_live_view` to `0.18.0`.

### Update mix.exs

```elixir
{:phoenix_live_view, "~> 0.18"},
{:petal_components, "~> 0.18"},
```

### Live View 0.18 updates

#### Phoenix.Component

Global replace: `Phoenix.LiveView.Helpers` --> `import Phoenix.Component`.

In some places you'll need to `import Phoenix.Component`. For example with `assign_new/3` calls.

#### Live title tag

`live_title_tag` is to be replaced with a component:

```html
<.live_title>
  <%= assigns[:page_title] || "Welcome" %>
</.live_title>
```

#### Renaming <.link>

Live View 0.18 deprecations:
  - `live_redirect` - deprecate in favor of new `<.link navigate={..}>` component of `Phoenix.Component`
  - `live_patch` - deprecate in favor of new `<.link patch={..}>` component of `Phoenix.Component`
  - `push_redirect` - deprecate in favor of new `push_navigate` function on `Phoenix.LiveView`

Petal Components has a `<.link>` component, but now Live View 0.18 has its own `<.link>`:

```
    <.link href="https://myapp.com">my app</.link>
    <.link navigate={@path}>remount</.link>
    <.link patch={@path}>patch</.link>
```

The attributes are a bit different to our link. So we renamed `<.link>` to `<.a>` to make it an easier upgrade.

Perform these global replaces:

```
`<.link` --> `<.a`
`</.link` --> `</.a`
```

This way, your app will still work with our `<a>` tags. However, we will eventually deprecate this in favour of the new Live View `<.link>`.

### Renaming Heroicons


PetalComponents now internally uses https://github.com/mveytsman/heroicons_elixir, which uses Heroicons V2.

Unfortunately Heroicons V2 renames a lot of icons and is kind of like another library. So we have renamed `PetalComponents.Heroicons` --> `PetalComponents.HeroiconsV1` for anyone who would like to continue using V1.

#### To keep using V1:

Do the global replaces:

```
Replace `PetalComponents.Heroicons` --> `PetalComponents.HeroiconsV1`
Replace `Heroicons.Solid` --> `HeroiconsV1.Solid`
Replace `Heroicons.Outline` --> `HeroiconsV1.Outline`
```

#### To use V2:

Delete all references to `PetalComponents.Heroicons`.

For every case you have used a Heroicon in a HEEX template you will have to update to the new syntax defined here: https://github.com/mveytsman/heroicons_elixir

Eg.

```html

<!-- Old way -->
<Heroicons.Solid.home class="" />

<!-- New way -->
<Heroicons.home solid class="" />
```

Note the `solid` attribute. For `outline`, you don't need any attributes.

The most annoying part is that a lot of the icon names have changed. You can see a list of the all the name changes here: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons/releases/tag/v2.0.0


#### Icon Button

We can't use a dynamic `Heroicons.Solid.render/1` anymore so instead we need to pass in the icon as the default slot.

Old way:

```html
<.icon_button to="/" icon={:trash} />
```

New way:

```html
<.icon_button to="/">
  <Heroicons.trash solid />
<./icon_button>
```

### Alpine JS updates

You can't use the bind shortcuts in the latest Live View.

Old:
```html
<div :class="..."></div>
```

New
```html
<div x-bind:class="..."></div>
```

You can do this global replace: ` :class=` --> ` x-bind:class=`.
You'll have to do it for each attribute using this bind syntax, eg: ` :aria-expanded=` --> ` x-bind:aria-expanded=`

There could be many more if you use Alpine a lot.
