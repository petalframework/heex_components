If you'd like to help out we've got a [Phoenix umbrella app](https://github.com/petalframework/petal_development) that allows you to easily contribute to Petal Components (which is installed as a git submodule). If you create a new component then feel free to submit a PR. Ideally one from the roadmap but we're open to any new components that would benefit others!
